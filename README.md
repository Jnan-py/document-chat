# Document Chat - AI-Powered Document Information Retriever

The **Document Chat** application is a Streamlit-based tool that allows you to interact with your PDF documents using a conversational interface. By leveraging Pinecone for vector storage and Google’s Generative AI (Gemini) along with LangChain tools, this app extracts and processes text from your PDFs, generates embeddings, and answers user queries based on the document content and conversation history.

## Features

- **PDF Document Upload:** Upload single or multiple PDF files for analysis.
- **Text Extraction & Chunking:** Extract text from PDFs and split it into manageable chunks using LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
- **Vector Store Integration:** Store text embeddings in a Pinecone index for similarity search.
- **Conversational Interface:** Chat with your document using an interactive chat interface powered by Google Generative AI.
- **Customizable Conversation:** The chat function uses the document context and conversation history to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jnan-py/document-chat.git
   cd document-chat
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your API keys (Google Generative AI and Pinecone):
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can set the keys in your Streamlit secrets.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Choose Chat Mode:**

   - **Single Doc Chat:** Upload one PDF file and interact with its content.
   - **Multiple Doc Chat:** Upload multiple PDF files; the texts are merged, and you can chat about the combined document content.

3. **Start Chatting:**
   - After uploading, the document is processed (text extraction, chunking, and vector store creation).
   - Use the chat input to ask questions about the document, and receive context-aware responses generated by the AI.
